# 30-Minute Coding Test: Quiz App

## Problem Statement

Build a simple Quiz App using Angular and TypeScript. The app should allow users to answer a series of multiple-choice questions, display the current score, and show a summary at the end.

### Requirements
- Display at least 3 multiple-choice questions (hardcoded in code).
- Show one question at a time with 3-4 answer options.
- Allow the user to select an answer and move to the next question.
- At the end, display the user's score and a summary of correct/incorrect answers.
- The UI should be clean and user-friendly.

### Bonus (Optional)
- Add a timer for each question.
- Allow the user to restart the quiz.

## Constraints
- Use only Angular, TypeScript, and basic CSS (no UI libraries).
- All data should be hardcoded (no API calls).
- The solution should be completed in 30 minutes.

## Getting Started
1. Run the Angular development server (`ng serve`).
2. Edit the source files to implement your solution.
3. Open the app in your browser at the provided URL.
